### Pump-breakdown
#### Anomaly Detection for identification pump breakdown


This is an implementation of anomaly detection technique in multi-dimensional time-series through Isolation Forest, LSTM Autoencoder and Reccurent EBM.
Please refer to [this amazing repo](https://github.com/KDD-OpenSource/DeepADoTS) for implementing SOTA techniques in anaomaly detection
in time series data.
