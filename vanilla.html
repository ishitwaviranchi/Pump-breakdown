    <h2>Secret Information</h2>
    <p>Babe I have been missing you so goddamn much. For the past two days, every morning I feel I have a cavity in my chest, like someone has scooped out my chest like an icre-cream bar. It feels so empty. I haven't been able to focus on work properly. I am missing you so much. Now that you're gone I am realising the value your presence held in my life. It's too bad that this happened. Even though it was short lived, I truely felt happy after a really really long time. My soul knows it. There's nothing I am asking of you I just want you to be happy in your life. It's just that this sucks. BIG TIME. I wish we could have continued talking even if our love was meant to rot and decay with time, but this sudden siezure feels disturbing. I would be wrong if I said I am not hoping. Fucking yes I am hoping. Cuz that's what makes me what I am. I would dream, I would hope of a future. Doesn't matter if it turns out to be the reality or not. I don't care. Stop me from dreaming. Afraid no force in this world can do that.</p>
